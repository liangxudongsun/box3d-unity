# Builds libbox3d.a as a STATIC library for iOS (arm64). RUN ON A MAC with Xcode.
# iOS plugins link statically — the C# side already imports "__Internal" on iOS
# (see Box3D/Bindings/Box3DLibrary.cs). Output goes to Plugins/iOS/.
# NOT YET RUN — no Mac available; verify + add a PluginImporter meta (iOS only) when first built.
#
# Environment (optional):
#   BOX3D_SRC     box3d checkout; auto-probed next to the repo if unset
#   BOX3D_DOUBLE  set (any value) to build the DOUBLE-precision variant. Static linking can't select
#                 by name (both archives export the same symbols → duplicate-symbol link error), so
#                 the double archive keeps the name libbox3d.a and is staged under Box3D.Native~/double-staging/iOS/ (outside Unity's asset scope, so it can never be auto-imported and linked by accident)
#                 — NOT shipped by default. To use double on iOS, EMBED the package (make it mutable),
#                 replace Plugins/iOS/libbox3d.a with this one, and set the BOX3D_DOUBLE C# define.
#                 See Docs/double-precision-plan.md.
